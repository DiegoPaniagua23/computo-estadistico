# Statistical Computing - Assignments and Projects

This repository contains the assignments and projects developed for the Statistical Computing course.

The main goal is to apply the theoretical concepts learned in class to practical analyses, primarily using the R programming language.

## Assignments

Below is an index of the course assignments. Each one includes its own `README` file detailing the objectives, file structure, and instructions to reproduce the results.
